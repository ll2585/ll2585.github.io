title: An App A Day
---

For the next 25 days, I will be making an app a day.  No guarantees on the quality of the app, this exercise is simply to help (force) myself to (re)learn how to program apps.

I will also link to the tutorials and describe what I am doing, so that, if I ever forget in the future, I can just go back here and review what I did.

Also, doing that will force me to understand what I am coding.

Let's start!
