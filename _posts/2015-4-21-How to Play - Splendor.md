title: How to Play - Splendor
---

So this is my first non-App A Day post. Since I enjoy board games, and I think the biggest hurdle for people to get into board games is learning how to play, I decided to make a website where I simplify the rules of board games that I know.


This mainly stems from the fact that the first strategic board game I learned (Settlers of Catan) was from an excellent [online tutorial](http://profeasy.com). Hopefully my tutorials will help newcomers easily learn these games as well.

I have a large laundry list of games I want to do, and the first is this game called Splendor.  It's essentially a resource-card-engine building game, with very simple rules. Check it out over [here](../howtoplay/). 

Right now the tutorial is pretty basic, but the site also includes a demo version versus bots that do random actions.

I may need to tidy up the joyride because there are too many steps now and it's not interactive at all.  

Also there are a few coding features that may need to be implemented (like selecting gems and what not) but once I get more feedback I will know what better to focus on.

This also took longer than I expected to so I may need to figure out a better way to build the future, more complicated games.
