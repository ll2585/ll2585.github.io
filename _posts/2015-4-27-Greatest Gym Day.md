Wow. Okay so I wasn't going to blog about my lifting routine but I had perhaps the greatest lifting day of my life today.

It all started out with being super tired from work, but I had the memory of my first muscle up still in mind (first muscle up achieved on Saturday, April 25, in Central Park, after failing to do one during the Battery Park soil volunteering for APEX, yes I am including as much detail because this is a memory I want to be able to remember forever. I tried a couple of times in Central Park, all failing, and then I tried once more and I got my first one and was super amazed, and then I tried again and got two, and then did it again for 3, but could not do it again.)

With that memory, I cranked out another 4 muscle ups, even before I started squatting. And my squat was a PR, hitting 5 for 335, which I had never done before.
The bench was a PR too, hitting 205 for 5 (really 4, last one was butt up but that was still better than ever.)
And the row was a PR also, with 245 for 5. (not super clean but much better than last week)

Besides that, I cranked out another 4/4/2 of muscle ups, as well as another 1/1 on the double bars that are annoying to do.

All in all, a very successful gym day, that I had to post about it so I remember it.
