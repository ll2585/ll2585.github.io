title: An App A Day - Days 11-16

So...for these days I relaly just followed Derek Banas' tutorials. These shouldn't even be counted as App a Day's but, .. I was really falling off the track because of that March Madness thing and I guess this is a good way to start to get back on.

No videos/images because I am kind of ashamed to include these as AaDs, but they're all here:

[12](https://github.com/ll2585/app_a_day.day_12)  
[13](https://github.com/ll2585/app_a_day.day_13)  
[14](https://github.com/ll2585/app_a_day.day_14)  
[15](https://github.com/ll2585/app_a_day.day_15)
[16](https://github.com/ll2585/app_a_day.day_16)

There may be one or two more of these, lame, tutorials. Then I guess it's time to combine these elements to make apps that are more functional, similar to my original ones.
